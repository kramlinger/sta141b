    "# Python SQL Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers essential methods for interacting with SQL databases in Python. We will demonstrate how to connect to a database, execute queries, and fetch results. All examples are shown in code blocks using triple backticks for syntax highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a database in Python, you can use the `sqlite3` module (or another database library if you are using a different database system). One common method is `sql.connect(filename)` or more precisely `sqlite3.connect(filename)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to a local SQLite database file\n",
    "# If the file does not exist, it will be created\n",
    "connection = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternatively, use an in-memory database for testing:\n",
    "# connection = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes a connection object (often named `connection` or `db`) that you will use to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Executing SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a connection, you can create a cursor and execute SQL commands using `db.execute(query)`. In many examples, you'll see this as `connection.execute(query)` or with a cursor like `cursor.execute(query)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a cursor from the connection\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample table (if it doesn't already exist)\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n",
    "        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n",
    "        name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "        email TEXT\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert some data\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n",
    "    INSERT INTO users (name, email)\n",
    "    VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com')\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't forget to commit your changes after INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Fetching Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing a `SELECT` query, you can retrieve results using these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchall()`**: Fetches **all** rows as a list of tuples.\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchone()`**: Fetches the **next** single row.\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchmany(n)`**: Fetches the **next n** rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select all rows\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch all rows as a list of tuples\n",
    "all_rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "print(\"All rows:\", all_rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows again\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch one row at a time\n",
    "first_row = cursor.fetchone()\n",
    "print(\"First row:\", first_row)\n",
    "\n",
    "second_row = cursor.fetchone()\n",
    "print(\"Second row:\", second_row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch many rows (for example, 2 rows)\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "some_rows = cursor.fetchmany(2)\n",
    "print(\"First 2 rows:\", some_rows)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, you can use these fetch methods for different pagination approaches or to process large datasets in smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sql.connect(filename)`** or **`sqlite3.connect(filename)`**: Establish a connection to an SQLite database.\n",
    "- **`db.execute(query)`** or **`cursor.execute(query)`**: Send SQL commands (like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, etc.).\n",

    "## 4. Setting Row Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, rows returned from a SQLite cursor are tuples. If you prefer dictionary-like access where columns can be accessed by name, you can set a row factory on the database connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Connect to the database\n",

    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",

    "# Now each row behaves like a dictionary\n",
    "for row in cursor:\n",
    "    print(row[\"name\"], row[\"email\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Reading SQL Queries with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the **pandas** library installed, you can directly read SQL query results into a Pandas DataFrame. This can be more convenient for data analysis and manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",

    "# Connect to the database\n",

    "Reading results into Pandas makes it easy to use DataFrame operations, plotting, and other data analysis features.\n",

    "\n",
    "With these commands and usage patterns, you can **create** and **manage** database structures, **insert/update/delete** data, **query** tables with powerful filtering, grouping, and joins, and **commit** changes to keep everything consistent.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Report the ten players that had the most home runs in their entire career.**  \n",
    "2. **Report the top three schools that produced the most players who ended up managing.**  \n",

    "> - `People` (biographical info on players)\n",
    "> - `Batting` (batting stats, including home runs)\n",
    "> - `Managers` (records of managers, referencing `playerID` for those who also played)\n",
    "> - `CollegePlaying` (links players to schools)\n",
    "> - `Schools` (school details, including `name_full`, `city`, etc.)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Connection**: We establish a connection to the SQLite file (`example.db` replaced with Lahman’s `../lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite`).\n",
    "2. **read_sql Function**: We use `pandas.read_sql(query, db)` to run SQL queries and return results as DataFrames, which are easy to inspect and print.\n",
    "3. **Aggregations & Joins**: \n",
    "   - **JOIN** statements allow us to combine data from multiple tables.  \n",
    "   - **GROUP BY** and **aggregate functions** (like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) let us compute totals or counts per group (in this case, per player or per school).  \n",
    "4. **Filtering / Searching**:\n",
    "   - We use `LIMIT` to restrict the top results (e.g., top 10, top 3).\n",
    "   - We use `LIKE '%Davis%'` to find any school name that contains “Davis.”\n",
    "   - We use `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to ensure we don’t count the same player multiple times.\n",
    "5. **Closing Connection**: Always good practice to close the SQLite database connection with `db.close()` once you’re done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use or modify these query examples to explore other aspects of the Lahman baseball data!\n",
