    "# Python SQL Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers essential methods for interacting with SQL databases in Python. We will demonstrate how to connect to a database, execute queries, and fetch results. All examples are shown in code blocks using triple backticks for syntax highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a database in Python, you can use the `sqlite3` module (or another database library if you are using a different database system). One common method is `sql.connect(filename)` or more precisely `sqlite3.connect(filename)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to a local SQLite database file\n",
    "# If the file does not exist, it will be created\n",
    "connection = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternatively, use an in-memory database for testing:\n",
    "# connection = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes a connection object (often named `connection` or `db`) that you will use to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Executing SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a connection, you can create a cursor and execute SQL commands using `db.execute(query)`. In many examples, you'll see this as `connection.execute(query)` or with a cursor like `cursor.execute(query)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a cursor from the connection\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample table (if it doesn't already exist)\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n",
    "        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n",
    "        name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "        email TEXT\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert some data\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n",
    "    INSERT INTO users (name, email)\n",
    "    VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com')\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't forget to commit your changes after INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Fetching Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing a `SELECT` query, you can retrieve results using these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchall()`**: Fetches **all** rows as a list of tuples.\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchone()`**: Fetches the **next** single row.\n",
    "- **`cur.fetchmany(n)`**: Fetches the **next n** rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select all rows\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch all rows as a list of tuples\n",
    "all_rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "print(\"All rows:\", all_rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows again\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch one row at a time\n",
    "first_row = cursor.fetchone()\n",
    "print(\"First row:\", first_row)\n",
    "\n",
    "second_row = cursor.fetchone()\n",
    "print(\"Second row:\", second_row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch many rows (for example, 2 rows)\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",
    "some_rows = cursor.fetchmany(2)\n",
    "print(\"First 2 rows:\", some_rows)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, you can use these fetch methods for different pagination approaches or to process large datasets in smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sql.connect(filename)`** or **`sqlite3.connect(filename)`**: Establish a connection to an SQLite database.\n",
    "- **`db.execute(query)`** or **`cursor.execute(query)`**: Send SQL commands (like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, etc.).\n",

    "## 4. Setting Row Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, rows returned from a SQLite cursor are tuples. If you prefer dictionary-like access where columns can be accessed by name, you can set a row factory on the database connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Connect to the database\n",

    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n",

    "# Now each row behaves like a dictionary\n",
    "for row in cursor:\n",
    "    print(row[\"name\"], row[\"email\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Reading SQL Queries with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the **pandas** library installed, you can directly read SQL query results into a Pandas DataFrame. This can be more convenient for data analysis and manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",

    "# Connect to the database\n",

    "Reading results into Pandas makes it easy to use DataFrame operations, plotting, and other data analysis features.\n",

    "1. **Always commit** after `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` queries to save changes.\n",

    "3. For **dictionary-like row access**, set `db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row`.\n",
    "4. SQLite is an easy starting point, but the same SQL statements apply broadly to other DBMSes (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with slight syntax differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these commands and usage patterns, you can **create** and **manage** database structures, **insert/update/delete** data, **query** tables with powerful filtering, grouping, and joins, and **commit** changes to keep everything consistent.\n",

    "# Example Python Code to Answer Questions Using Lahman’s Baseball Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how you can use **pandas** (`read_sql`) and **sqlite3** to answer the following questions from the Lahman baseball database (`../lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Report the ten players that had the most home runs in their entire career.**  \n",
    "2. **Report the top three schools that produced the most players who ended up managing.**  \n",
    "3. **How many players went to UCD?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The Lahman database contains multiple tables, including:\n",
    "> - `People` (biographical info on players)\n",
    "> - `Batting` (batting stats, including home runs)\n",
    "> - `Managers` (records of managers, referencing `playerID` for those who also played)\n",
    "> - `CollegePlaying` (links players to schools)\n",
    "> - `Schools` (school details, including `name_full`, `city`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3 as sql\n",

    "\n",

    "# - We join People and Batting on playerID to get each player's HR stats.\n",
    "# - SUM(b.HR) computes total home runs across all seasons.\n",
    "# - GROUP BY ensures we sum per player.\n",
    "# - ORDER BY careerHR DESC sorts by descending order of total HR.\n",

    "# - Managers table references playerID if the manager was also a player.\n",
    "# - CollegePlaying links a playerID to the school(s) they attended.\n",

    "# - We group by the full school name (s.name_full) to count how many distinct playerIDs\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Connection**: We establish a connection to the SQLite file (`example.db` replaced with Lahman’s `../lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite`).\n",
    "2. **read_sql Function**: We use `pandas.read_sql(query, db)` to run SQL queries and return results as DataFrames, which are easy to inspect and print.\n",
    "3. **Aggregations & Joins**: \n",
    "   - **JOIN** statements allow us to combine data from multiple tables.  \n",
    "   - **GROUP BY** and **aggregate functions** (like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) let us compute totals or counts per group (in this case, per player or per school).  \n",
    "4. **Filtering / Searching**:\n",
    "   - We use `LIMIT` to restrict the top results (e.g., top 10, top 3).\n",
    "   - We use `LIKE '%Davis%'` to find any school name that contains “Davis.”\n",
    "   - We use `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to ensure we don’t count the same player multiple times.\n",
    "5. **Closing Connection**: Always good practice to close the SQLite database connection with `db.close()` once you’re done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use or modify these query examples to explore other aspects of the Lahman baseball data!\n",
