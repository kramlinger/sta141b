    "## Debugging Tips and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or incorrect behaviors in your code. Here are some general rules and strategies you can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the Error Message Carefully**  \n",
    "   - Check the exact wording of the error message. Often, it tells you what went wrong and where it happened.\n",
    "   - Look at the *type* of error (e.g., `TypeError`, `NameError`, `SyntaxError`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify the Line Causing the Error**  \n",
    "   - Error messages typically point to the file name and line number.\n",
    "   - If the error is inside a function, consider whether the *root cause* might be the *caller* of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inspect Variables**  \n",
    "   - Use `print()` statements or an interactive debugger (`pdb` in Python) to check the values of variables.\n",
    "   - Confirm that variables are what you expect them to be (e.g., `str` vs. `int`, lists vs. dicts, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Isolate the Problem**  \n",
    "   - Break your code into smaller pieces.\n",
    "   - Test each piece separately to locate where the behavior becomes incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check for Common Mistakes**  \n",
    "   - Typos, spelling errors, and mismatched function or variable names.\n",
    "   - Off-by-one errors in loops.\n",
    "   - Indentation issues in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Consider Edge Cases**  \n",
    "   - How does your function handle unexpected data types or missing/empty inputs?\n",
    "   - Are there boundary conditions that might cause errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use a Systematic Approach**  \n",
    "   - Change one thing at a time and test again.\n",
    "   - Keep track of your changes so you can roll back if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use a Debugger**  \n",
    "   - Python’s built-in debugger (`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`) can step through code line by line.\n",
    "   - Many IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) and Jupyter offer interactive debugging tools.\n"

    "## Common Python Error Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some frequently encountered errors in Python, their common causes, and possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. SyntaxError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Python found invalid syntax (e.g., missing colon, unmatched parentheses, incorrect indentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Carefully check your code for typos, missing colons, or unbalanced parentheses.\n",
    "- Make sure indentation is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Missing colon after if statement\n",
    "if True\n",
    "    print(\"This will cause a SyntaxError\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. NameError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Attempting to use a variable or function name that hasn’t been defined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Ensure the variable or function is spelled correctly and defined before use.\n",
    "- Check that you haven’t accidentally deleted or overwritten the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    return \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greeting)  # NameError: name 'greeting' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. TypeError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Performing an operation on incompatible data types (e.g., adding a string to an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., \\`str()\\`, \\`int()\\`, \\`float()\\`).\n",
    "- Check variables to ensure they are what you expect (e.g., string vs. integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"5\"\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "print(x + y)  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ValueError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- A function receives an argument of the correct type but with an invalid value \n",
    "  (e.g., converting a non-numeric string to an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Validate your input before passing it to functions.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions where invalid values might appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num_str = \"abc\"\n",
    "print(int(num_str))  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. IndexError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Trying to access a list or array index that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Check your loops and index ranges.\n",
    "- Make sure you’re not exceeding the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(my_list[3])  # IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. KeyError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Trying to access a dictionary key that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Check that the key exists before accessing it.\n",
    "- Use \\`dict.get(key, default_value)\\` to safely access or provide a default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"c\"])  # KeyError: 'c'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. AttributeError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Attempting to access an attribute or method that doesn’t exist on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Double-check spelling and confirm the attribute/method is defined.\n",
    "- Verify the object is of the correct type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "text.append(\"!\")  # AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. ImportError / ModuleNotFoundError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Importing a module that isn’t installed, or using an incorrect import path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Check if you need to install a package (e.g., \\`pip install package_name\\`).\n",
    "- Verify the spelling of the module name and your Python environment’s configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Check divisor values before performing division.\n",
    "- Use conditionals or exception handling to prevent dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "print(x / y)  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. IndentationError\n",
    "**Reason**:  \n",
    "- Your code blocks are misaligned. Python relies on consistent indentation (spaces/tabs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:  \n",
    "- Use consistent indentation throughout your code (preferably 4 spaces).\n",
    "- Make sure nested blocks have additional indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "print(\"This will cause an IndentationError\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Summary**:  \n",

    "## Using the IPython Debugger: set_trace\n",

    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import set_trace from IPython.core.debugger.\n",
    "2. Place set_trace() at any point in your code where you want to pause and inspect variables.\n",
    "3. When execution hits set_trace(), a console-like interface will appear inside your notebook or terminal.\n",
    "4. You can type commands like:\n",
    "   - `n` (next) to go to the next line.\n",
    "   - `c` (continue) to resume normal execution.\n",
    "   - `p variable_name` to print the value of a variable.\n",
    "   - `q` (quit) to exit the debugger completely.\n",

    "## Catching Errors in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **exceptions** are raised when something goes wrong during runtime. You can handle these exceptions gracefully using `try` and `except` blocks. This helps prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly and allows you to decide what should happen when an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage: Catch All Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    2 + \"d\"\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    print('That does not work!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The `try` block attempts to execute code that might fail (`2 + \"d\"` in this example). \n",
    "- If any error (exception) occurs, the `except` block runs. Here, any error prints `\"That does not work!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach catches **all** possible exceptions, which can sometimes be too broad. Typically, it’s better to specify which exceptions you want to handle.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type (e.g., adding a string to an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have two `except TypeError` blocks in this snippet. In practice, only the **first** matching `except` will run. The second `except TypeError` will never be reached. Typically, you only need one block per error type unless you’re doing something more advanced with exception handling.\n",

    "while True:  \n",
    "    x[i] += 2\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What Happens Here?**  \n",
    "  This code will raise an **IndexError** once `i` becomes `4` because `x[4]` is out of range for `x = [0, 1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you can handle the error gracefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = list(range(4))\n",

    "    i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - `try: x[i] += 2` attempts to increment the value at index `i`.\n",
    "  - If an **IndexError** occurs (because `i` exceeds the list bounds), the code `break`s out of the loop.\n",
    "  - If a **TypeError** occurs, the code uses `pass`, which simply ignores the error and moves on. This might be used if the list contains a string or some other non-numeric type that can’t be incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this loop, `x` will be `[2, 3, 4, 5]` because each integer in the original list `[0, 1, 2, 3]` was incremented by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Mixed Types\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = list(range(4))  # [0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "x.append('a')       # Now x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 'a']\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while True:  \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        x[i] += 2\n",
    "    except IndexError:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    except TypeError:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The list now contains integers and a string. When you attempt `x[i] += 2`, it works fine for integers but raises a `TypeError` when it hits `'a'`.\n",
    "  - The `TypeError` is caught, so the loop continues instead of crashing.\n",
    "  - The `IndexError` check will break out of the loop once `i` exceeds the list length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final list might look like this: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 'a']` because each integer was incremented by 2, and `'a'` was left alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `except IndexError:`?\n",
    "\n",
    "When iterating or accessing list elements by an index that may go out of range, you can **gracefully handle** the situation using `except IndexError`. Instead of your program crashing, you can decide what happens next (e.g., break out of a loop, substitute a default value, or log an error message). \n",
    "\n",
    "**In short**, `except IndexError:` means: \"If Python raises an `IndexError` inside this `try` block, run the code in this `except` block instead of crashing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `try`/`except`** to handle exceptions that you know might occur (e.g., `IndexError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`).\n",
    "2. **Catch Specific Exceptions** whenever possible for clarity and to avoid masking real errors.\n",
    "3. **Use multiple except blocks** for different error types if you need different recovery methods.\n",
    "4. **`except IndexError:`** is particularly useful for controlling loops that might overrun a list’s boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "By catching errors, you can prevent your program from stopping unexpectedly and provide more informative messages or fallback behavior.\n",
